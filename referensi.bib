abstract = {Understanding the hepatotoxicity of drugs and chemicals is essential for progress in the pharmaceutical industry, medical science and academic research. The study of hepatotoxicity in vitro is complicated by the difficulty of maintaining hepatocytes in culture due to a lack of understanding of the humoral and matrix requirements of these cells. A variety of in vitro models of the liver have been developed, such as perfused livers, liver slices and three-dimensional perfused bioreactors, but the static cell culture is the most commonly used system. In this review we present the advantages and disadvantages of each system and their roles in the study of hepatotoxicity. We will also discuss how the various culture conditions such as medium and matrix composition affect the systems. The technological advances, which started the fields of genomics, proteomics and metabonomics are playing a very important role in uncovering novel biochemical pathways and markers of toxicity. Several of these studies have focused on hepatotoxicity, particularly on the effects of acetaminophen, carbon tetrachloride and aflatoxin B1. Finally, we will discuss the new field of systems biology, which focuses on interpreting and integrating data from all of the other fields.},

This new formulation is nor sequential nor iterative, doesn't require use of Laplace or Fourier transform and provides a g-function by solving a single system of linear equations assembled in a block matrix system. A method to accelerate the integration of the finite-line source model based on Chebyshev polynomials is also introduced. Although it suffers from a fixed cost in terms of computational time, this approach allows to speed up the g-function assessment even further when used jointly with the block matrix formulation on large fields. By using both strategies, constructing the g-function of a ground heat exchanger composed of 50 regularly spaced boreholes can be achieved in less than half-second while committing only a small relative error. The speed and compactness of the block matrix formulation could be useful to design ground heat exchangers with optimization-based algorithms, which can require the assessment of several thousand g-functions.},

@article{Huang2019,
abstract = {The eigenvalue problem of a graph Laplacian matrix L arising from a simple, connected and undirected graph has been given more attention due to its extensive applications, such as spectral clustering, community detection, complex network, image processing and so on. The associated matrix L is symmetric, positive semi-definite, and is usually large and sparse. It is often of interest for finding some smallest positive eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors. However, the singularity of L makes the classical eigensolvers inefficient since we need to factorize L for the purpose of solving large and sparse linear systems exactly. The next difficulty is that it is usually prohibitive to factorize L generated by real network problems from big data such as social media transactional databases, and sensor systems because there is in general not only local connections. In this paper, we propose a trimming to cure the singularity of L according to its special property: zero row/column sum. This remedy technique leads us to solve a positive definite linear system reduced in one dimension and then recover the result to get a suitable solution of the original system involved in an eigensolver. Besides, we apply a deflating approach to exclude the influence of converged eigenvalues. We show how to apply the idea of trimming to the graph Laplacian eigenvalue problem together with a deflated term and a target shift. Accordingly, based on the inexact residual Arnoldi (Lee, 2007; Lee and Stewart, 2007) method, we propose an integrated eigensolver for this kind of L combining with the implicit remedy of the singularity, an effective deflation for convergent eigenvalues and the shift–invert enhancement. Numerical experiments reveal that the integrated eigensolver outperforms the classical Arnoldi/Lanczos method for computing some smallest positive eigeninformation especially when the LU factorization is not available.},

In this paper, a Parallel Symmetric Matrix-based Predictive Bayes Classifier (PSM-PBC) model is developed for efficient Big Data computation and information sharing in Cloud environment. Initially, the Tridiagonal Symmetric Matrix is constructed on distributed Big Data in parallel. This approach enables an increase in the rate of data computation using a Householder transformation. A Cross-Validated Bayes Classifier then evaluates real-value diagonal search data to improve the prediction rate. Finally, the MapReduce function on Bayes Classes provides efficient predictive analytics regarding Big Data. The experimental evaluations are conducted with Amazon EC2 Cloud Big Data sets and exhibit improvement of the prediction rate by 10.55% along with a reduction in computation time by 40.93% compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Graphene, with impressive electronic properties, have high potential in the microelectronic field. However, graphene itself is a zero bandgap material which is not suitable for digital logic gates and its application. Thus, much focus is on graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) that are narrow strips of graphene. During GNRs fabrication process, the occurrence of defects that ultimately change electronic properties of graphene is difficult to avoid. The modelling of GNRs with defects is crucial to study the non-idealities effects. In this work, nearest-neighbor tight-binding (TB) model for GNRs is presented with three main simplifying assumptions. They are utilization of basis function, Hamiltonian operator discretization and plane wave approximation. Two major edges of GNRs, armchair-edged GNRs (AGNRs) and zigzag-edged GNRs (ZGNRs) are explored. With single vacancy (SV) defects, the components within the Hamiltonian operator are transformed due to the disappearance of tight-binding energies around the missing carbon atoms in GNRs. The size of the lattices namely width and length are varied and studied. Non-equilibrium Green"s function (NEGF) formalism is employed to obtain the electronics structure namely band structure and density of states (DOS) and all simulation is implemented in MATLAB. The band structure and DOS plot are then compared between pristine and defected GNRs under varying length and width of GNRs. It is revealed that there are clear distinctions between band structure, numerical DOS and Green"s function DOS of pristine and defective GNRs.},

abstract = {Graphene, being a gapless semiconductor, cannot be used in pristine form for nano-electronic applications. Therefore, it is essential to generate a finite gap in the energy dispersion at Dirac point. We present here the tight-binding model Hamiltonian taking into account of various interactions for tuning band gap in graphene. The model Hamiltonian describes the hopping of the p-electrons up to third nearest-neighbours, substrate effects, Coulomb interaction at two sub-lattices, electron-phonon interaction in graphene-on-substrates and high phonon frequency vibrations , besides the bi-layer graphene. We have solved the Hamiltonian using Zubarev's double time single particle Green's function technique. The quasi-particle energies, electron band dispersions, the expression for effective band gap and the density of states (DOS) are calculated numerically. The results are discussed by varying different model parameters of the system. It is observed that the electron DOS and band dispersion exhibit linear energy dependence near Dirac point for nearest-neighbour hopping integral. However, the second and third nearest-neighbour hoppings provide asymmetry in DOS. The band dispersions exhibit wider band gaps with stronger substrate effect. The modified gap in graphene-on-substrate attains its maximum value for Coulomb interaction energy U C ¼ 1:7t 1. The critical Coulomb interaction is enhanced to U C ¼ 2:5t 1 to produce maximum band gap in the presence of electron-phonon interaction and phonon vibration. The bi-layer graphene exhibits Mexican hat type band gap near Dirac point for transverse gating potential. The other conclusions for the present work are described in the text.},

abstract = {The future of humanity depends increasingly on the performance of cities. Big data provide new and powerful ways of studying and improving coupled urban environmental, social, and economic systems to achieve urban sustainability. However, the term big data has been defined variably, and its urban applications have so far been sporadic in terms of research topic and location. A comprehensive review of big data-based urban environment, society, and sustainability (UESS) research is much needed. The aim of this study was to summarize the big data-based UESS research using a systematic review approach in combination with bibliometric and thematic analyses. The results showed that the numbers of publications and citations of related articles have been increasing exponentially in recent years. The most frequently used big data in UESS research are human behavior data, and the major analytical methods are of five types: classification, clustering, regression, association rules, and social network analysis. The major research topics of big data-based UESS research include urban mobility, urban land use and planning, environmental sustainability, public health and safety, social equity, tourism, resources and energy utilization, real estate, and retail, accommodation and catering. Big data benefit UESS research by proving a people-oriented perspective, timely and real-time information, and fine-resolution spatial dynamics. In addition, several obstacles were identified to applying big data in UESS research, which are related to data quality and acquisition, data storage and management, data security and privacy, data cleaning and preprocessing, and data analysis and information mining. To move forward, future research should integrate multiple big data sources, develop and utilize new methods such as deep learning and cloud computing, and expand the application fields to focus on the interactions between human activities and urban environments. This review can contribute to understanding the current situation of big data-based UESS research, and provide a reference for studies of this topic in the future.},

abstract = {We present a study of noncovalent coupling of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with graphene/graphene oxide (GO) employing optical spectroscopy (UV–visible optical absorption, Raman spectroscopy), scanning microscopy, and theoretical calculations (molecular dynamics simulations, DFT calculations). The optical absorption of SWNT-GO aqueous solution reveals a transformation of bands corresponding to both SWNTs and GO that can be explained by the formation of nanohybrids of two systems. The spectra showed suppression of the intensities of the bands related to the electronic transitions between the first pair of Van Hove singularities in the electronic density of states of semiconducting SWNTs that was explained by the charge transfer from SWNTs to GO. The nanohybrids are not destroyed after deposition of SWNT-GO aqueous solution on a film. The analysis of Raman spectra of the SWNT-GO film reveals the charge transfer between the components. The strong coupling induces stress and causes structural deformations in the carbon nanostructures. The appearance of this effect is in good agreement with the performed calculations. This work provides new experimental and theoretical results on the energetics and structural characteristics of SWNT-GO nanohybrids which may be scientifically and practically significant as they can be used to elaborate solar cells, batteries, sensors, etc.},

abstract = {Materials exhibit fascinating properties when one or more of their dimensions is reduced to the nanometer scale. One of the most immediate observations when reducing the size of materials to the nanometer scale is the confinement in the movement of electrons due to the quantum confinement effect. This leads to discretization of electron energy levels depending on the confinement size of the material. The resulting structure exhibits interesting novel optoelectronic, physicochemical, mechanical, and magnetic properties not shown by the corresponding bulk structures of the same material. This chapter presents insights on quantum nanostructures, which are classified according to their degrees of quantization, especially quantum dots (QDs). Further, the special properties exhibited by zero-dimensional structures, such as photoluminescence, multiple exciton generation, and size tunable bandgap, are discussed. This chapter also introduces various synthesis and fabrication processes used to fabricate QDs in exclusive applications, such as displays, biological labels, and photovoltaics.},

@article{Hidri2018,
abstract = {The increasing computational complexity of Big Data software requires the scale up of the nodes of clusters of commodity hardware that have been used widely for Big Data workloads. Thus, FPGA-based accelerators and GPU devices have recently become a first class citizen in data centers. Utilizing these devices is not trivial task however from an engineering effort perspective since developers versed in distributed computing frameworks, such as Apache Spark are used to developing in higher level languages and APIs, like Python and Scala, while accelerators require the use of low-level APIs like Cuda and OpenCl. Through recent developments in accelerator virtualization like VineTalk [6] a software layer that handles the complex communication between applications and FPGAs or GPU devices, software development using accelerators has been simplified. This paper presents HetSpark, a heterogeneous modification of Apache Spark. HetSpark enables Apache Spark to operate with two classes of executors: an accelerated class, and a commodity class. HetSpark applications are expected to use VineTalk for their entire interaction with accelerators. The schedulers of HetSpark are sophisticated enough to detect the existence of VineTalk routines in the java binary code. Thus, they take decisions as to which tasks require the use of accelerators, and they send them only to executors of the former class. Finally, we evaluated thoroughly the performance of HetSpark with different mixes of executors of the two different classes. When applications run linear tasks, we observed that the use of CPU-only accelerators is preferable to GPU enhanced accelerators, while for applications with computationally challenging tasks, the time savings from the use of GPUs compensate for data transfers between commodity and accelerated executors.},

abstract = {Technology has become inevitable in human life, especially the growth of Internet of Things (IoT), which enables communication and interaction with various devices. However, IoT has been proven to be vulnerable to security breaches. Therefore, it is necessary to develop fool proof solutions by creating new technologies or combining existing technologies to address the security issues. Deep learning, a branch of machine learning has shown promising results in previous studies for detection of security breaches. Additionally, IoT devices generate large volumes, variety, and veracity of data. Thus, when big data technologies are incorporated, higher performance and better data handling can be achieved. Hence, we have conducted a comprehensive survey on state-of-the-art deep learning, IoT security, and big data technologies. Further, a comparative analysis and the relationship among deep learning, IoT security, and big data technologies have also been discussed. Further, we have derived a thematic taxonomy from the comparative analysis of technical studies of the three aforementioned domains. Finally, we have identified and discussed the challenges in incorporating deep learning for IoT security using big data technologies and have provided directions to future researchers on the IoT security aspects.},

abstract = {The process of spray pyrolysis was investigated theoretically using a model that describes the evolution of the droplet size, solvent vapor concentration in the carrier gas, and both droplet and gas temperatures along the reactor axis. The model also accounts for solute concentration profiles and solute precipitation in the solution droplets. The model was used to describe the evaporation of sodium chloride aqueous solution droplets in diffusion dryers and hot-wall reactors as a function of reactor residence time, droplet size (a few microns), solution molality (up to 2 M), droplet concentration (106-107 cm-3), relative humidity of the carrier gas (0-50%) and reactor wall conditions. Decreasing initial droplet size and solution molality accelerated droplet evaporation and resulted in smaller droplets at the onset of solute nucleation. Decreasing droplet concentration and carrier gas inlet relative humidity as well as increasing wall temperature (up to 350°C) or axial wall temperature gradient (up to 100°C cm-1) increased the droplet evaporation rate, but did not change appreciably the droplet size at the point of precipitation for a given droplet size and solute concentration. Thus, control of droplet size at the onset of solute nucleation by varying process parameters other than the solution concentration and initial droplet size is limited. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Indium tin oxide (ITO) films were deposited on glass substrates by dip-coating and thermal pyrolysis methods. Sn (IV) is often used in the spray method as a precursor salt, but in this research we have employed a new procedure that uses Sn (II) and In(NO3)3 for preparation of transparent conductive thin films. Then, colloidal Ag was deposited on the ITO layers in order to compare the two synthesis methods, and the structural and electrical properties of the resultant films were investigated by FESEM, XRD, and four-terminal resistometry. The obtained films are polycrystalline with a preferred orientation of (200). The XRD patterns of the films indicate that in both films, the Sn phase is crystallized separately from In2O 3. The presence of a Sn peak and the overall low intensity of XRD peaks suggest relative crystallization of ITO structure. For this reason, Ag films were deposited by dip coating method using a colloidal sol. By analyzing the XRD patterns of Ag-ITO films after eliminating the Sn peak, the increased intensity of the peaks confirmed the relatively good crystallization of the ITO films. The results show that the films with a sheet resistance as low as 2 × 10-2 $\omega$cm, which is beneficial for solar cells, were achieved. {\textcopyright} Wroclaw University of Technology.},

abstract = {An accurate approximation for the Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel limiting slopes based on the IAPWS (the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam) equations for water was proposed. It is valid for T=273.15−523.15K and p=0−100MPa and uses one self-consistent formula and parameters set for all six coefficients. It uses a special extrapolation procedure for values below 273.15 K that is not dependent on equations of state for supercooled water and can be applied down to 173.15 K. The computations took only about 1% of the time that was required for the computations based on original IAPWS equations. Usage of the IAPWS-IF97 (IAPWS Industrial Formulation 1997) equation instead of the IAPWS95 equation for the water density is also discussed. The developed procedure was also applied to other popular equations for Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel coefficients (by Archer and Wang and by Bradley and Pitzer). Tabulated IAPWS95 based values for the Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel limiting slopes for T=273−723K, p=0−100MPa and their extrapolation down to 173 K are given.},

abstract = {We report electronic properties of a hydrogen atom encaged by an endohedral cavity under the influence of a weak plasma interaction. We implement a finite-difference approach to solve the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation for a hydrogen atom embedded in an endohedral cavity modeled by the Woods-Saxon potential with well depth V0, inner radius R0, thickness $\Delta$, and smooth parameter $\gamma$. The plasma interaction is described by a Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel screening potential that characterizes the plasma in terms of a Debye screening length $\lambda$D. The electronic properties of the endohedral hydrogen atom are reported for selected endohedral cavity well depths, V0, and screening lengths, $\lambda$D, that emulate different confinement and plasma conditions. We find that for low screening lengths, the endohedral cavity potential dominates over the plasma interaction by confining the electron within the cavity. For large screening lengths, a competition between both interactions is observed. We assess and report the photo-ionization cross section, dipole polarizability, mean excitation energy, and electronic stopping cross section as function of $\lambda$D and V0. We find a decrease of the Generalized Oscillator Strength (GOS) when the final excitation is to an s state as the plasma screening length decreases. For a final excitation into a p state, we find an increase in the GOS as the endohedral cavity well-depth increases. For the case of the electronic stopping cross section, we find that the plasma screening and endohedral cavity effects are larger in the low-to-intermediate projectile energies for all potential well depths considered. Our results agree well to available theoretical and experimental data and are a first step towards the understanding of dipole and generalized oscillator strength dependent properties of an atom in extreme conditions encaged by an endohedral cavity immersed in a plasma medium.},

abstract = {Job scheduling is one of the most crucial components in managing resources, and efficient execution of big data applications. Specifically, scheduling jobs in a cloud-deployed cluster are challenging as the cloud offers different types of Virtual Machines (VMs) and jobs can be heterogeneous. The default big data processing framework schedulers fail to reduce the cost of VM usages in the cloud environment while satisfying the performance constraints of each job. The existing works in cluster scheduling mainly focus on improving job performance and do not leverage from VM types on the cloud to reduce cost. In this paper, we propose efficient scheduling algorithms that reduce the cost of resource usage in a cloud-deployed Apache Spark cluster. In addition, the proposed algorithms can also prioritise jobs based on their given deadlines. Besides, the proposed scheduling algorithms are online and adaptive to cluster changes. We have also implemented the proposed algorithms on top of Apache Mesos. Furthermore, we have performed extensive experiments on real datasets and compared to the existing schedulers to showcase the superiority of our proposed algorithms. The results indicate that our algorithms can reduce resource usage cost up to 34% under different workloads and improve job performance.},

Modern graphene research has been directed towards the exploration of new graphene derivatives and their utilisations for fabrication of products and devices. The enhancement of graphene properties by functionalization or surface modification is another innovative approach. However, like other 2D materials, graphene research also needs amendments and up-gradation in the light of recent scientific output. In this contribution, we have reassessed the recent research output on graphene and graphene-based materials for applications in different fields. For the reader's comfort and to maintain lucidity, first, some fundamental aspects of graphene are discussed and then recent overviews in graphene research are explored in a systematic manner.

abstract = {The formation of zirconia particles prepared by low-pressure spray pyrolysis (LPSP) was studied experimentally and numerically. A numerical model was developed, and it is the first to quantitatively explain the phenomena occurring in the LPSP system. Under certain operational conditions, particle formation was based on a one-droplet to one-particle conversion, as found in the spray pyrolysis process under atmospheric pressure conditions. On the other hand, nanoparticles were generated at higher temperatures and under conditions of lower pressure. Zirconia nanoparticles were successfully produced under experimental conditions of 1600 °C, 30 Torr with 10 l/min nitrogen as a carrier gas. The mass and heat transport calculation indicated that the evaporation rate would increase rapidly with increasing temperature and decreasing pressure in the furnace. The model considered flow regimes, and accounted for the regime range from continuum to free-molecular, depending on the Knudsen number. A very high evaporation rate led to the assumption that droplets were ruptured instantaneously, resulting in the production of monomers. Nanoparticles were then formed by the nucleation of monomers to form clusters, and then by the coagulation between clusters and surface condensation of monomers onto clusters. To predict the size distribution of nanoparticles, a population balance analysis called the nodal method was used. The simulation results showed reasonable agreement with the experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Calculations without parameter fitting have shown a semiquantitative agreement with experimental data, reproducing the nonmonotonic concentration dependence of activity coefficients for LiI, NaI, and KI solutions. A good agreement with experimental data was obtained for NaI-water mixtures in the concentration range up to 7 mol/kg. The correct ordering of activity coefficients for the salts with different cations was also reproduced and explained as resulting not only from decreasing solvation in the series LiI > NaI > KI > CsI but also due to increasing ion pairing with increasing cation size. The applicability limits of the EDH theory are outlined.},

abstract = {The goal of this chapter is to provide an overview of metal oxide nanostructures. A comprehensive literature survey of nanometal oxides has been done and is presented here. Metal oxide nanostructures have attracted substantial research interest, mainly because of their unique characteristics at nano dimensions compared to those of bulk or single-particle species. Generally, the distinctive electronic structure defines the specific metallic, semiconductor, or insulator characteristics of metal oxide nanomaterials. Methods of synthesis are categorized based on the processes involved in nanoparticle formation and are broadly classified as either bottom-up or top-down. Most of the commonly investigated top-down and bottom-up methodologies for synthesis of metal oxide nanostructures are comprehensively discussed in the following sections. Nanoparticles fabricated via the bottom-up method are built atom by atom, molecule by molecule, or cluster by cluster. It will be seen that the complex and fine nanostructures fabricated via the bottom-up methods are difficult to achieve by the usual top-down processes.},

Recently, graphene-based composites have attracted increasing attention for electrochemical energy storage by combining the merits of graphene and other electrochemical materials to achieve superior electrochemical performances. In this review, we start with the properties and production methods for graphene, summarize the recent research progress on graphene-based composites for electrochemical energy storage from the structural and interfacial engineering viewpoints, and underscore the significance of the dimensionality and compound interface characteristics in the rational construction and design of these composites. We also discuss recent specific applications of graphene-based composites, from electrochemical capacitors and lithium-ion batteries to emerging electrochemical energy storage systems, such as metal-air and metal-sulfur batteries. The new features and challenges of graphene-based composites for electrochemical energy storage are also summarized and discussed. This review is specifically aimed at offering new perspectives on the combination of graphene with other electrochemical materials to optimize their performances, and will outline ways to further improve graphene-based composites towards the next generation of electrochemical energy storage devices.},

abstract = {In this work, two exercises are described that are designed to teach students about the evolution and behavior of the electronic bands of graphene and bilayer graphene. These exercises involve performing extended H{\"{u}}ckel molecular orbital theory calculations on polyacenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In the first exercise, students investigate how the molecular orbitals of polyacenes converge into bands as polyacene size increases. Further, students learn that long-range interactions cause frontier-orbital crossing as the size of the polyacene increases. In the second exercise, the concepts of band structures, band crossing, and k-space are explored using the results of frontier orbital calculations on $\pi$-stacked dimers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which represent molecular analogues of layered 2D materials. The results of these calculations show how the geometry and layer-layer offset of the dimer system can affect its electronic structure, and the results can be extrapolated to provide a framework for understanding why subtle changes in the relative orientations of the layers in bilayer graphene can produce qualitative changes in the electronic properties. These calculations are easily implemented with Python or with widely available algebraic manipulation software such as Maple or Mathematica. These exercises are accessible to students who have experience with extended H{\"{u}}ckel molecular orbital theory and are suitable for inclusion in the physical chemistry curriculum at the upper-level undergraduate or introductory graduate level.},

Solving the equations of the model involves a system of nonlinear equations where the unknowns are the chemical potential and the electric potential on the adsorbent surface. To solve these equations an iterative procedure is presented. The main advantages of the developed model, when applied to the Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel approximation, are intuitiveness and the difficulty in drawing physical meaning of parameters, which is simpler, and in fact delivers similar results to those obtained with the Poisson-Boltzmann model, without the Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel simplification, in the cases studied.},

Graphene oxide can be described as a random distribution of oxidized areas with some oxygen-containing functional group in a carbon atom plane. In the present study GO powder was prepared by the Hummers method. The obtained material from Hummer's method was identified as GO powder by XRD and FTIR characterization. After the Hummers method, the resulted GO powder mixed with nickel sulfate as the catalyst, treated in Ar/H2 (4:1) environment under microwave irradiation. The Ar and H2 gases were expected to release the oxygen from the GO powder and to prevent the released oxygen back to the material. In this study, we did variations on the flowrate of Ar/H2 gases, the mass of GO powder in the system and the microwave power. The optimum oxygen group reduction has occurred when the material was treated in the Ar/H2 gas flow rate of 0.4 liters/minute, the sample mass of 0.5 g and the microwave power of 720 Watt as the reduction of oxygen atomic bond confirmed by FTIR spectrum.},

In the markets where complex interactions between competitors, search intermediaries and consumers create a network, B2B relationships can be inferred from consumer search patterns, and can then be modeled to gauge the online performance. A commercial dataset from ComScore's US panel of one million users is used to illustrate a new approach to measure and evaluate the online performance of competitors in the US airline market. The methodology and associated performance framework demonstrate the potential for new forms of market intelligence based on the visualization of market networks, online performance calculated from matrix algorithms, the measurement of the impact of search intermediaries, and the identification of latent relationships. This research makes theoretical and empirical contributions to the debate on the use of big data for B2B market analytics.

The purpose of this research is aimed at finding an optimum substrate temperature during spray pyrolysis process in order to obtain FTO substrates with the desired characteristics. For this purpose, soda lime glasses were deposited with a mixture of tin and fluorine doping precursors using a special modified ultrasonic nebulizer with a variation in substrate heating temperature of 250, 300, 350, 400, and 450°C. All the fabricated samples were characterized by using x-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis spectrometry, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and digital multimeter. On the basis of investigation, the best result was obtained in the substrate heated at 300 °C, providing an electrical resistance of 8 ohm/sq and optical transmittance of 74%. This research creates a chance for the next fabrication of TCO glass with desired properties using simple-low cost facilities.},

abstract = {Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is a material with a unique set of electrical and physical properties. The potential of rGO for numerous semiconductor applications, however, has not been fully realized because the dependence of its band gap on the chemical structure and, specifically, on the presence of terminal functional groups has not been systematically studied and, as a result, there are no efficient methods for tuning the band gap. Here we report that the band gap of rGO can be increased and, importantly, tuned from 0.264 to 0.786 eV by controlling the surface concentration of epoxide groups using a developed mild oxidation treatment with nitric acid, HNO3. Increasing the concentration of an HNO3 treatment solution gradually increases the surface concentration of epoxides without introducing microscopic defects or d-spacing changes and, thus, produces functionalized rGO materials with desirable properties for semiconductor applications. A combination of experimental measurements using infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and density functional theory calculations demonstrates that epoxides are unique among oxygen-containing functional groups for allowing to tune the band gap. Unlike epoxides, other oxygen-containing functional groups are not effective: hydroxyls do not change the band gap, while carbonyls and carboxyls break the hexagonal carbon-ring structure of rGO.},

abstract = {Today the most significant public health problem is Heart Failure (HF). There are a lot of raw medical data available to healthcare organizations in the form of structured and unstructured datasets, but the need is to analyze this data to get information and to make intelligent decisions. By using data mining, classification tool on a real dataset of cardiac patients we propose a model which classified these patients into four major classes. This model will help to identify the risk of HF and patients who have no HF signs but structural irregularities. We can also identify the patients having HF signs and irregularities and those having the critical stage of HF. This paper provides a detailed summary of modern strategies for management and analysis of HF patients by classes (1 to 4) that have appeared in the past few years.},

abstract = {Calculations are performed on cubic SiC by using the extended Huckel method. Crystalline silicon and diamond are also considered. It is shown that the inclusion of excited (s*) atomic orbitals in the basis set, a suggestion recently made in the literature, as well as a convenient change in a few valence shell empirical parameters provide a good description of valence and conduction bands, in particular giving rise to the appearance of the indirect gap. The parametrization of valence orbitals is shown to have physical justification and its generality is stressed. A good agreement of cubic SiC band structure results when crystalline silicon and diamond parameters are used together with a scaling transformation according to the crystal lattice parameters. The independent choice of s* parameters in all three materials is discussed.},

abstract = {A colleague at the Technical University of Denmark has often stated: “Life is too short for electrolytes”. Another well-known scientist in the field of molecular simulation has recently said during an international Thermodynamics conference: “All my life I have tried to keep myself away from water and electrolytes”. Sadly, what these statements correctly imply is that there are far too many unclear questions and concepts in electrolyte thermodynamics, and associated difficulties in modeling electrolyte solutions. In this work, we attempt to shed some light on some important concepts and misconceptions in electrolyte thermodynamics associated with the development of electrolyte equations of state, with emphasis on those based on the Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel theory. Detailed mathematics is needed for some of the derivations but for brevity and in order to emphasize the principles rather than the derivations, the latter are omitted. We first discuss the peculiarities of electrolyte thermodynamics and associated modeling and continue with a literature review of equations of state for electrolyte solutions. Next we will provide a modern derivation of the Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel and Born equations and discuss their assumptions in detail to answer some of the confusion that exists in current literature on the applicability ranges and show how the different versions of the Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel and Born models are related. A discussion and outlook section conclude this review. Several of the statements in this work challenge “accepted beliefs” in electrolyte thermodynamics and, while we believe that this challenge is justified, we hope that a useful debate can result in improved and predictive thermodynamic models for electrolyte solutions.},

abstract = {Graphene oxide (GO) can be used as an electron acceptor for polymeric solar cells but still band gap matching for electron donor and acceptor demands more study. The generation of the exciton in such materials is intimately related to the optical band gap. However, exciton dissociation is related to transport band gap that controls the device performance, particularly the open circuit voltage and short circuit current. Therefore, the modulation of the optical gap is useful because it results into tuning of the transport gap. The interest of the present work is to study the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) at room temperature, using environmental friendly reagents like glucose, fructose and ascorbic acid for the modulation of a band gap. It has been found that glucose and fructose function effectively only in presence of NH<inf>4</inf>OH. Although ascorbic acid can reduce GO alone, NH<inf>4</inf>OH speeds up the reaction. The optical band gap of GO can be reduced and tuned effectively from 2.7 eV to 1.15 eV.},

By proposing a Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) localized subclustering method, disk I/O burden of the MapReduce based clustering approaches has been solved as well. The comparison of the clustering results with similar works shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm in precision and cluster validity indexes. The proposed method also shows relative robustness to the presence of noise in comparison with similar recent works. The proposed approach shows better precision and validity index in comparison with MapReduce base algorithms while outperforming MapReduce based approaches in computational burden. The scalability of the proposed method is almost similar to the standard Spark machine learning library.},

abstract = {Functional nanostructured materials have attracted great attention over the past several decades owing to their unique physical and chemical properties, while their applications have been proven to be advantageous not only in fundamental scientific areas, but also in many technological fields. Spray pyrolysis (SP), which is particularly facile, effective, highly scalable and suitable for on-line continuous production, offers significant potential for the rational design and synthesis of various functional nanostructured materials with tailorable composition and morphology. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in various functional nanostructured materials synthesized by SP and their potential applications in energy storage and conversion. After a brief introduction to the equipment, components, and working principles of the SP technique, we thoroughly describe the guidelines and strategies for designing particles with controlled morphology, composition, and interior architecture, including hollow structures, dense spheres, yolk-shell structures, core-shell structures, nanoplates, nanorods, nanowires, thin films, and various nanocomposites. Thereafter, we demonstrate their suitability for a wide range of energy storage and conversion applications, including electrode materials for rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, highly active catalysts for hydrogen production, carbon dioxide reduction and fuel cells, and photoelectric materials for solar cells. Finally, the potential advantages and challenges of SP for the preparation of nanostructured materials are particularly emphasized and discussed, and several perspectives on future research and development directions of SP are highlighted. We expect that this continuous, one-pot, and controllable synthetic technology can serve as a reference for preparing various advanced functional materials for broader applications.},

abstract = {The randomness of the wind speed leads to the intermittency of wind power, which is a challenge to realize wind power energy as reliable and renewable power. The prediction of wind speed time series can promote the use of wind energy. However, the traditional stand-alone methods are unable to meet the requirements of wind speed big data environments. In the study, a hybrid distributed computing framework on Apache Spark is applied for wind speed big data forecasting. Using the distributed computing strategy, the framework can divide the wind speed big data into RDD groups and operate them in parallel. In the framework, a modified wind speed extreme learning machine predictor is built using the Distributed Computing Process strategy, enhanced by the data decomposition and result reconstruction components on Apache Spark. The experimental results indicate that the proposed distributed computing framework on Spark can forecast wind speed big data in multi-step accurately. Besides, the effectiveness of different components in the framework is verified. It is also proved that the proposed distributed computing framework has a faster computation speed when processing big data, compared to the stand-alone method.},

abstract = {We describe matrix computations available in the cluster programming framework, Apache Spark. Out of the box, Spark provides abstractions and implementations for distributed matrices and optimization routines using these matrices. When translating single-node algorithms to run on a distributed cluster, we observe that often a simple idea is enough: separating matrix operations from vector operations and shipping the matrix operations to be ran on the cluster, while keeping vector operations local to the driver. In the case of the Singular Value Decomposition, by taking this idea to an extreme, we are able to exploit the computational power of a cluster, while running code written decades ago for a single core. Another example is our Spark port of the popular TFOCS optimization package, originally built for MATLAB, which allows for solving Linear programs as well as a variety of other convex programs. We conclude with a comprehensive set of benchmarks for hardware accelerated matrix computations from the JVM, which is interesting in its own right, as many cluster programming frameworks use the JVM. The contributions described in this paper are already merged into Apache Spark and available on Spark installations by default, and commercially supported by a slew of companies which provide further services.},

We have designed octylamine-functionalized graphene oxide materials for energy harvesting and as an anti-corrosion coating for metal alloy protection in a 3.5% NaCl medium. The material has been characterized by different techniques to confirm the structure and composition of the modified graphene oxide sheet: FTIR spectroscopy, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, FESEM and TEM. The electrochemical stability and corrosion inhibition efficiency were studied by electrochemical methods. The electrochemical stability increased with an increase in the applied voltage up to 500 mV, and the corrosion inhibition efficiency was shown to be 73%. The coating stability studies showed a long stability time in the corrosion medium.},

The influence of carrier gas pressure on structural, morphological, optical and electrical properties of the film are determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray, atomic force microscopy, UV–Vis spectrophotometry and Hall effect measurement. Structural parameters such as pole density, orientation factor, crystallite size, micro strain and dislocation density were analysed using XRD data. The scanning electron microscopy studies display superior morphology and surface roughness of the films which were found to increase with pressure. Optical studies on the films revealed a variation in band gap from 1.78 to 1.66 eV for were the raise of pressure from 0.1 to 0.2 Pa. A single strong emission peak at about 825 nm is observed in photoluminescence spectra with enhanced intensity which may be attributed to near band edge emission. Grown SnS thin film exhibits p-type conductivity, which was confirmed from the Hall effect measurement. The low resistivity and higher carrier concentration are found to be $$0.235\,\Omega \,\hbox {cm}$$0.235$\Omega$cmand $$5.04\times 10^{18}\,\hbox {cm}^{-3}$$5.04×1018cm-3, respectively. These properties were then correlated with the deposition parameters.

A huge amount of data on different types of crimes taking place in different geographic locations is collected and stored annually. It is highly essential to analyze data so that potential solutions for solving and mitigating the crime incidents and predicting similar incident patterns for future becomes possible. Then it can be carried out using big data and various machine learning techniques in conjunction. The paper introduced a solution to the crime prediction problem using Naive Bayes classifier, which includes finding the most likely criminal of a particular crime incident when the history of similar crime incidents has been provided with the incident-level crime data. The incident-level crime data is provided as a crime dataset which includes incident date and location, crime type, criminal ID and the acquaintances are the attributes or crime parameters. The acquaintances are the suspects whose names are either directly involved in the incident or indirectly the acquaintances of the criminal. Acquiring a real-time crime dataset is a difficult process in practice due to confidentiality principle. So, crime dataset are used for the inputs using the state of the art methods. The proposed system is tested for the crime prediction problem using the data learning, and the experimental results show that the proposed system provides better results and finding of the potential solutions and crime patterns.},

Thus, the developed network intrusion detection systems aim to identify attacks or malicious activities in a network environment. Various methods have been already proposed for finding an effective and efficient solution to detect and prevent intrusion in the network, ensuring network security and privacy. Machine learning is an effective analysis framework to detect any anomalous events occurred in the network traffic flow. Based on this framework, the paper in hand evaluates the performance of four well-known classification algorithms: SVM. Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest using Apache Spark, a big data processing tool for intrusion detection in network traffic. The overall performance comparison is evaluated in terms of detection accuracy, building time and prediction time. Experimental results on UNSW-NB15, a recent public dataset for network intrusion detection, show an important advantage for Random Forest classifier among other well-known classifiers in terms of detection accuracy and prediction time, using the complete dataset with all 42 features.},

Spray pyrolysis deposition is used to grow the required thin films, as it is an affordable deposition technique which can be integrated into a standard CMOS processing sequence. A model for spray pyrolysis deposition is developed and implemented within the Level Set framework using Monte Carlo techniques. Two models for the topography modification due to spray pyrolysis deposition are presented, with an electric nozzle and a pressure atomizing nozzle. The resulting film growth is described as a layer by layer deposition of the individual droplets which reach the wafer surface and deposit as flat round disks or as a CVD-like process, depending on whether the droplets form a vapor near the interface or they deposit a film only after surface collision. Some additional geometries are simulated in order to analyze how the spray pyrolysis technique coats trench structures, essential for increasing the surface area of the gas sensing layer.},

abstract = {The future of humanity depends increasingly on the performance of cities. Big data provide new and powerful ways of studying and improving coupled urban environmental, social, and economic systems to achieve urban sustainability. However, the term big data has been defined variably, and its urban applications have so far been sporadic in terms of research topic and location. A comprehensive review of big data-based urban environment, society, and sustainability (UESS) research is much needed. The aim of this study was to summarize the big data-based UESS research using a systematic review approach in combination with bibliometric and thematic analyses. The results showed that the numbers of publications and citations of related articles have been increasing exponentially in recent years. The most frequently used big data in UESS research are human behavior data, and the major analytical methods are of five types: classification, clustering, regression, association rules, and social network analysis. The major research topics of big data-based UESS research include urban mobility, urban land use and planning, environmental sustainability, public health and safety, social equity, tourism, resources and energy utilization, real estate, and retail, accommodation and catering. Big data benefit UESS research by proving a people-oriented perspective, timely and real-time information, and fine-resolution spatial dynamics. In addition, several obstacles were identified to applying big data in UESS research, which are related to data quality and acquisition, data storage and management, data security and privacy, data cleaning and preprocessing, and data analysis and information mining. To move forward, future research should integrate multiple big data sources, develop and utilize new methods such as deep learning and cloud computing, and expand the application fields to focus on the interactions between human activities and urban environments. This review can contribute to understanding the current situation of big data-based UESS research, and provide a reference for studies of this topic in the future.},

Different block placement strategies can be used to make it highly fault-tolerant and to improve throughput and access time. The HDFS allows the user to (i) specify the block size to be used for partitioning a given file, (ii) issue only sequential read and append operations. It does not allow the user to perform random read and random write operations. This paper proposes an enhanced HDFS (REHDFS) that (i) explores different block placement and block read strategies, (ii) implements random read and random write operations. The proposed architecture is implemented and evaluated. The proposed load based block access strategy performed better than the other block retrieval strategies.

Deep learning, a branch of machine learning has shown promising results in previous studies for detection of security breaches. Additionally, IoT devices generate large volumes, variety, and veracity of data. Thus, when big data technologies are incorporated, higher performance and better data handling can be achieved. Hence, we have conducted a comprehensive survey on state-of-the-art deep learning, IoT security, and big data technologies. Further, a comparative analysis and the relationship among deep learning, IoT security, and big data technologies have also been discussed. Further, we have derived a thematic taxonomy from the comparative analysis of technical studies of the three aforementioned domains. Finally, we have identified and discussed the challenges in incorporating deep learning for IoT security using big data technologies and have provided directions to future researchers on the IoT security aspects.},

This phenomenon—dubbed as Big Data—has applications for a wide assortment of industries, including the construction industry. The construction industry already deals with large volumes of heterogeneous data; which is expected to increase exponentially as technologies such as sensor networks and the Internet of Things are commoditised. In this paper, we present a detailed survey of the literature, investigating the application of Big Data techniques in the construction industry. We reviewed related works published in the databases of American Association of Civil Engineers (ASCE), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), and Elsevier Science Direct Digital Library. While the application of data analytics in the construction industry is not new, the adoption of Big Data technologies in this industry remains at a nascent stage and lags the broad uptake of these technologies in other fields. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no comprehensive survey of Big Data techniques in the context of the construction industry. This paper fills the void and presents a wide-ranging interdisciplinary review of literature of fields such as statistics, data mining and warehousing, machine learning, and Big Data Analytics in the context of the construction industry. We discuss the current state of adoption of Big Data in the construction industry and discuss the future potential of such technologies across the multiple domain-specific sub-areas of the construction industry. We also propose open issues and directions for future work along with potential pitfalls associated with Big Data adoption in the industry.},

abstract = {The smart city is described as the place where citizens live well-organized urban lives, ensure their sustainability, and cause the least damage to the environment through information and communication technology (ICTs). Big data and the internet of things sensors and applications collect data that allows effective technology solutions. In water management, smart water meters reporting water quality and use, alerting leaks to the water company, or potential contamination. In this paper, the Supervisory controller and data acquirement (SCADA) Approach for sustainable water management in the smart city based on IoT and Big Data Analytics. Big data analysis is a new technical term for the collection from deployed IoT sensors of huge amounts of relevant data to track the physical state, use and quality of the device. The Internet of Things (IoT) software can be extended to the entire water supply system and to device product use to carry out this principle of big data analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that the implementation aims to proactively control the usage of water by both companies and customers and to achieve higher levels of sustainable water supply.},

abstract = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene are nanocarbon materials with excellent mechanical and electrical properties. It is a great challenge to develop practical applications of these nanocarbons. One of the methods to make use of their excellent properties on the macroscopic scale is to assemble them into yarns, because the yarn can achieve higher orientation and higher content of nanocarbon. The establishment of the practical fabrication processes of the yarns of CNT and graphene (mainly reduced graphene oxide, rGO) is strongly demanded. The present review focuses on the fabrication processes of CNT and rGO yarns by analyzing respective procedures to contribute the development of practical applications of these yarns. The effectiveness of the fabrication processes is discussed based on the obtained mechanical properties and electrical conductivities.},

@article{Lin2016,
abstract = {With the explosive growth of digital data communications in synergistic operating networks and cloud computing service, hyperconnected manufacturing collaboration systems face the challenges of extracting, processing, and analyzing data from multiple distributed web sources. Although semantic web technologies provide the solution to web data interoperability by storing the semantic web standard in relational databases for processing and analyzing of web-accessible heterogeneous digital data, web data storage and retrieval via the predefined schema of relational / SQL databases has become increasingly inefficient with the advent of big data. In response to this problem, the Hadoop Ecosystem System is being adopted to reduce the complexity of moving data to and from the big data cloud platform. This paper proposes a novel approach in a set of the Hadoop tools for information integration and interoperability across hyperconnected manufacturing collaboration systems. In the Hadoop approach, data is "Extracted" from the web sources, "Loaded" into a set of the NoSQL Hadoop Database (HBase) tables, and then "Transformed" and integrated into the desired format model with Hive's schema-on-read. A case study was conducted to illustrate that the Hadoop Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) approach for the syntax and semantics web data integration could be adopted across the global smartphone value chain.},

abstract = {Using a combination of continuum modeling, atomistic simulations, and numerical optimization, we estimate the flexural rigidity of a graphene sheet. We consider a rectangular sheet that is initially parallel to a rigid substrate. The sheet interacts with the substrate by van der Waals forces and deflects in response to loading on a pair of opposite edges. To estimate the flexural rigidity, we model the graphene sheet as a continuum and numerically solve an appropriate differential equation for the transverse deflection. This solution depends on the flexural rigidity. We then use an optimization procedure to find the value of the flexural rigidity that minimizes the difference between the numerical solutions and the deflections predicted by atomistic simulations. This procedure predicts a flexural rigidity of 0.26nN nm = 1.62 eV. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 M.W. Roberts et al.},

The ITO sol solution was prepared by dispersing LPSP-prepared ITO nanoparticles into ultra pure water. The nanoparticle ITO film was deposited on a glass substrate using a dip-coating method and then annealed in air at various temperatures. The optical transmittances of the ITO films were measured by UV-Vis spectrometry, and the films were found to have a high transparency to visible light (in the case of a film thickness of 250 nm annealed at 400°C, the transparency was in excess of 95% over the range $\lambda$=450-800 nm, with a maximum value near 100% at wavelengths above $\lambda$=700 nm). The optical transmittances of the films were influenced by the size of the ITO particle used, the film thickness and the annealing temperature. The ITO films showed a minimum resistivity of 9.5×10 -2 $\Omega$ cm, and their resistivity was affected by both the ITO particle size and the annealing temperature used. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

abstract = {Road accidents are one of the most relevant causes of injuries and death worldwide, and therefore, they constitute a significant field of research on the use of advanced algorithms and techniques to analyze and predict traffic accidents and determine the most relevant elements that contribute to road accidents. The research of road accident prediction aims to respond to the challenge of offer tools to generate a more secure mobility environment, and ultimately, save lives. This paper aims to provide an overview of the state of the art in the prediction of road accidents through machine learning algorithms and advanced techniques for analyzing information, such as convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks, among other deep learning architectures. Furthermore, in this article, a compendium and study of the most used data sources for the road accident forecast is made. And a classification is proposed according to its origin and characteristics, such as open data, measurement technologies, onboard equipment and social media data. For the analysis of the information, the different algorithms employed to make predictions about road accidents are listed and compared, as well as their applicability depending on the types of data being analyzed, along with the results obtained and their ease of interpretation and analysis. The best results reported by the authors are obtained when two or more analytic techniques are combined, in such a way that analysis of the obtained results is strengthened. Among the future challenges in road traffic forecasting lies the enhancement of the scope of the proposed models and predictions by the incorporation of heterogeneous data sources, that include geo spatial data, information from traffic volume, traffic statistics, video, sound, text and sentiment from social media, that many authors concur that can improve the precision and accuracy of the analysis and predictions.},

Compared to conventional wet-oxidation methods, oxygen plasma and UV/Ozone treatments do not require harsh chemicals to perform, allow faster oxidation rates, and enable site-specific oxidation.

The acquaintances are the suspects whose names are either directly involved in the incident or indirectly the acquaintances of the criminal. Acquiring the crime dataset is a difficult process in practice due to confidentiality principle. So the crime dataset is generated synthetically using the state-of-the-art methods.

Within the H{\"{u}}ckel theory the formulas for the Coulson bond orders are easily obtained in a closed form for annulenes, which enables the production of analytical expressions for some of the aromaticity measures. These analytical functions are used to study the ring size dependence of current aromaticity indices. Besides, HMO calculations of polycyclic benzenoids complete the analysis of the electronic aromaticity indices reviewed in this paper, by showing how HMO theory explains the changes in aromaticity due to annulation.

One of the most immediate observations when reducing the size of materials to the nanometer scale is the confinement in the movement of electrons due to the quantum confinement effect. This leads to discretization of electron energy levels depending on the confinement size of the material. The resulting structure exhibits interesting novel optoelectronic, physicochemical, mechanical, and magnetic properties not shown by the corresponding bulk structures of the same material. This chapter presents insights on quantum nanostructures, which are classified according to their degrees of quantization, especially quantum dots (QDs). Further, the special properties exhibited by zero-dimensional structures, such as photoluminescence, multiple exciton generation, and size tunable bandgap, are discussed. This chapter also introduces various synthesis and fabrication processes used to fabricate QDs in exclusive applications, such as displays, biological labels, and photovoltaics.},

The thermogravimetric curve overlap ratio was applied to evaluate the simulation of biomass by hemi-cellulose, cellulose and lignin. The results indicated that biomass pyrolysis characteristics could be well simulated by its components and the results from the overlap ratio were compared with the content derived from chemical separation. The temperature was programmed to divide each phase of biomass pyrolysis to investigate further components ratio in biomass mass loss process.

If flow conditions that make an accident more likely can be reliably predicted in real time, it would be possible to use this information to take preventive measures, such as changing variable speed limits before an accident happens. The system uses case-based reasoning, an artificial intelligence methodology, which predicts the outcome of current traffic flow conditions based on historical flow data cases that led to accidents. This study focusses on investigating if case-based reasoning using spatio-temporal flow data is a viable method to differentiate between accidents and non-accidents by evaluating the capability of the retrieval mechanism, the first stage in a case-based reasoning system, to retrieve a traffic flow case from the case base with the same outcome as the target case. Preliminary results from experiments using real-world spatio-temporal traffic flow data and accident data are promising. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Hard materials, e.g. diamond and cubic boron nitride (c-BN), are widely applied to improve the lifetime and the performance of many kinds of cutting and forming tools. These materials are usually used at high temperature, so the study of stability on these materials at high temperature is very important. However, diamond is a low resistance to the oxidation, it should be replaced with the boron-based hard materials. Recently, boron-carbon-nitrogen (B-C-N) ternary materials are expected to possess a high hardness, a high thermal stability at high temperature. We estimated the hardness and the stability of B-C-N materials at high temperature by the extended H{\"{u}}ckel method. The extended H{\"{u}}ckel method is one of the molecular orbital calculations and needs the cluster model of materials for the calculation. The cluster model of B-C-N materials was regarded as a zinc blende structure. In the present work, we used two physical quantities, i.e. a cohesive energy and an energy fluctuation, as a measure of hardness and stability of materials. The cohesive energy indicates the coherence of bonds between atoms. The energy fluctuation shows the reactivity of materials. Hardness, structure, solid-state properties and reactivity of materials can be estimated from these physical quantities. When the composition of B-C-N materials was boron: 25 at.%, nitrogen: 25 at.% and carbon: 50 at.%, the cohesive energy was the lowest. This result implies B-C-N ternary materials are not harder than c-BN and/or diamond. Cubic-BN was the lowest energy fluctuation of B-C-N materials, and the energy fluctuation increased as increasing of carbon atom. The reactivity of B-C-N materials was high at a high temperature with an increase of carbon atoms. These results imply that B-C-N materials are not suitable for the hard cutting materials. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A reliable benchmarking system is crucial for the contractors to evaluate the profitability performance of project tenders. Existing benchmarks are ineffective in the tender evaluation task for three reasons. Firstly, these benchmarks are mostly based on the profit margins as the only key performance indicator (KPI) while there are other KPIs fit to drive the evaluation process. Secondly, these benchmarks don't take project context into account, thereby restricts their predictive accuracy. And finally, these benchmarks are obtained from small subsets of data, making it hard to generalise. As a result, estimators cannot probe into tenders to judge the strengths and weaknesses of their bids. This advancement is critical for not only choosing more lucrative opportunities but also driving negotiations during the tendering process. This study aims to develop a benchmarking system for tender evaluation using Big Data of 1.2 terabytes, comprising 5.7 million cells. A holistic list of seventeen (17) KPIs is identified from the email data using Text Mining approaches. Besides, eight (8) key project attributes are chosen for ensuring context-aware benchmarking using Focused Group Interviews (FGIs). At the crux of this work lies the proposition of a deep ensemble learner based on the decomposition-integration methodology. In the decomposition stage, the model predicts several attribute-specific benchmarks for each KPI using our proposed context-aware algorithm. In the integration stage, deep neural network-based learners are trained to generate final project-sensitive KPI benchmark. The learner is deployed in the Spring tool to support the tender evaluation of power infrastructure projects. A tender of 60km underground cabling project is evaluated using the proposed learner. The system spontaneously identified KPIs in the tender that require further attention to achieve greater profitability performance.},

abstract = {Influence of humidity on properties of graphene was investigated and a comparison of graphene and polymer humidity sensors was carried out. It is shown the graphene sensors have higher response in comparison with nanoporous polymer membranes. The resistance of the latter ones is 150 GOhm and decreases in 7.5 times in case of 60% relative humidity. The resistance of graphene decreases in 4 times from 100 kOhm. This was shown to be due to the expanding of band gap of graphene caused by the adsorbed water that may create the defects in the lattice or transfer the charge, the sign of which depends on the relative position of HOMO and LOMO of water and the Dirac point of graphene.},

abstract = {For graphene to be used in semiconductor applications, a 'wide energy gap' of at least 0.5{\^{a}}.eV at the Dirac energy must be opened without the introduction of atomic defects. However, such a wide energy gap has not been realized in graphene, except in the cases of narrow, chemically terminated graphene nanostructures with inevitable edge defects. Here, we demonstrated that a wide energy gap of 0.74{\^{a}}.eV, which is larger than that of germanium, could be opened in uniform monolayer graphene without the introduction of atomic defects into graphene. The wide energy gap was opened through the adsorption of self-assembled twisted sodium nanostrips. Furthermore, the energy gap was reversibly controllable through the alternate adsorption of sodium and oxygen. The opening of such a wide energy gap with minimal degradation of mobility could improve the applicability of graphene in semiconductor devices, which would result in a major advancement in graphene technology.},

@article{Sahu2017,
abstract = {Graphene, being a gapless semiconductor, cannot be used in pristine form for nano-electronic applications. Therefore, it is essential to generate a finite gap in the energy dispersion at Dirac point. We present here the tight-binding model Hamiltonian taking into account of various interactions for tuning band gap in graphene. The model Hamiltonian describes the hopping of the p-electrons up to third nearest-neighbours, substrate effects, Coulomb interaction at two sub-lattices, electron-phonon interaction in graphene-on-substrates and high phonon frequency vibrations , besides the bi-layer graphene. We have solved the Hamiltonian using Zubarev's double time single particle Green's function technique. The quasi-particle energies, electron band dispersions, the expression for effective band gap and the density of states (DOS) are calculated numerically. The results are discussed by varying different model parameters of the system. It is observed that the electron DOS and band dispersion exhibit linear energy dependence near Dirac point for nearest-neighbour hopping integral. However, the second and third nearest-neighbour hoppings provide asymmetry in DOS. The band dispersions exhibit wider band gaps with stronger substrate effect. The modified gap in graphene-on-substrate attains its maximum value for Coulomb interaction energy U C ¼ 1:7t 1. The critical Coulomb interaction is enhanced to U C ¼ 2:5t 1 to produce maximum band gap in the presence of electron-phonon interaction and phonon vibration. The bi-layer graphene exhibits Mexican hat type band gap near Dirac point for transverse gating potential. The other conclusions for the present work are described in the text.},

abstract = {We studied the modulation of Raman scattering intensities of molecules on graphene by tuning the graphene Fermi level with electrical field effect (EFE). A series of metal phthalocyanine (M-Pc) molecules (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn), which have different molecular energy levels, were used as probe molecules. The Raman intensities of all these M-Pc molecules become weaker when the graphene Fermi level is up-shifted by applying a positive gate voltage, while they become stronger when the graphene Fermi level is down-shifted by applying a negative gate voltage. However, this Raman intensity modulation only occurs when applying the gate voltage with a fast sweep rate, while it is nearly absent when applying the gate voltage with a slow sweep rate, which is likely due to the arising of the hysteresis effect in the graphene EFE. In addition, the Raman modulation ability for M-Pc molecules with smaller energy gaps is larger than that with larger energy gaps due to the difference in the energy alignment between graphene and these M-Pc molecules. Furthermore, this modulation shows the greatest one on single-layer graphene and mainly comes from the first layer of molecules which are in direct contact with graphene. The Raman modulation of molecules in GERS with the EFE suggests that the Raman enhancement for GERS occurs through a chemical enhancement mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We present a detailed study of the effects of L\'evy $\alpha$-stable disorder distributions on the optical and localization properties of excitonic systems. These distributions are a generalization of commonly studied Gaussian randomness ($\alpha = 2$). However, the more general case ($\alpha < 2$) includes also heavy-tailed behavior with a divergent second moment. These types of distributions give rise to novel effects, such as exchange broadening of the absorption spectra and anomalous localization of the excitonic states, which has been found in various excitonic systems. We provide a thorough examination of the localization behavior and the absorption spectra of excitons in chains with L\'evy $\alpha$-stable diagonal disorder. Several regimes are considered in detail: (i) weak disorder and small systems, where finite size effects become significant; (ii) intermediate disorder and/or larger systems for which exciton states around the exciton band edge spread over a number of monomers, and (iii) strong disorder where the exciton wave functions resemble the individual molecular states. We propose analytical approaches to describe the disorder scaling of relevant quantities for these three regimes of localization, which match excellently with numerical results. We also show the appearance of short localization segments caused by outliers (monomers having transition energies larger than the exciton band width). Such states give rise to an additional structure in the absorption spectrum, density of states, and in the nontrivial disorder scaling of the absorption band width.},

abstract = {Graphene, with impressive electronic properties, have high potential in the microelectronic field. However, graphene itself is a zero bandgap material which is not suitable for digital logic gates and its application. Thus, much focus is on graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) that are narrow strips of graphene. During GNRs fabrication process, the occurrence of defects that ultimately change electronic properties of graphene is difficult to avoid. The modelling of GNRs with defects is crucial to study the non-idealities effects. In this work, nearest-neighbor tight-binding (TB) model for GNRs is presented with three main simplifying assumptions. They are utilization of basis function, Hamiltonian operator discretization and plane wave approximation. Two major edges of GNRs, armchair-edged GNRs (AGNRs) and zigzag-edged GNRs (ZGNRs) are explored. With single vacancy (SV) defects, the components within the Hamiltonian operator are transformed due to the disappearance of tight-binding energies around the missing carbon atoms in GNRs. The size of the lattices namely width and length are varied and studied. Non-equilibrium Green"s function (NEGF) formalism is employed to obtain the electronics structure namely band structure and density of states (DOS) and all simulation is implemented in MATLAB. The band structure and DOS plot are then compared between pristine and defected GNRs under varying length and width of GNRs. It is revealed that there are clear distinctions between band structure, numerical DOS and Green"s function DOS of pristine and defective GNRs.},

abstract = {In this article we present an effective Hamiltonian approach for discrete time quantum random walk. A form of the Hamiltonian for one-dimensional quantum walk has been prescribed, utilizing the fact that Hamiltonians are generators of time translations. Then an attempt has been made to generalize the techniques to higher dimensions. We find that the Hamiltonian can be written as the sum of a Weyl Hamiltonian and a Dirac comb potential. The time evolution operator obtained from this prescribed Hamiltonian is in complete agreement with that of the standard approach. But in higher dimension we find that the time evolution operator is additive, instead of being multiplicative (see Chandrashekar, Sci. Rep. 3, 2829 (2013)). We showed that in the case of two-step walk, the time evolution operator effectively can have multiplicative form. In the case of a square lattice, quantum walk has been studied computationally for different coins and the results for both the additive and the multiplicative approaches have been compared. Using the graphene Hamiltonian, the walk has been studied on a graphene lattice and we conclude the preference of additive approach over the multiplicative one.},
